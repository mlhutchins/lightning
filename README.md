lightning
=========

A WWLLN visualization tool to show realtime lightning activity.

The data for the map is currently unavailable publicly, but it is currently generated with the live WWLLN data using the MATLAB function loc2json (https://github.com/mlhutchins/functions/blob/master/loc2json.m).

The map can currently display real-time data, pause the display, and move around in 30-second increments.  The total strokes shown statistic is given for the globe and an optional selection box; each stroke is displayed for 10 seconds.

The terminator code is taken from https://github.com/marmat/google-maps-api-addons.
